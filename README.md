# hotel-assistant-project

Everyone would appreciate an easy way to book hotels for their next destination. What better way to implement a hotel booking assistant? In the initial conceptual phase of our research, we created a workflow diagram to guide the implementation of our project. During the development phase, we encountered some challenges in the development of our proposed approach. However, we remained committed to overcoming these obstacles and continued to work diligently towards achieving our objectives.
